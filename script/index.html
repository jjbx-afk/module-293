        <h4>Introduction to Levantine Music :</h4>

        <p class="text">
            The Levant, encompassing countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Jordan,
            and Palestine,
            boasts a rich and deeply rooted musical tradition. This music, at
            the crossroads of Arab,
            Mediterranean, and Oriental influences, relies on a variety of
            iconic instruments.</p>

        <p class="text">
            These instruments, often handcrafted by local artisans, are used to
            perform classical compositions,
            folk songs, improvisations (taqsim), and even to accompany dances
            and spiritual rituals.
            Each instrument embodies a part of the cultural soul of the Levant,
            evoking emotions ranging from joy
            to melancholy through their unique sounds.

            <h4>What Are Maqamat?</h4>
            <p>

                A maqam is like a musical "mode" or "scale", but much more than
                that.
                It’s a framework of notes and intervals (the spaces between the
                notes) that forms the
                foundation of a melody.

                Each maqam is tied to a specific mood or
                emotion, almost like
                a musical color palette.

            <p>
                In Western music, you have major and minor scales. Major feels
                happy, and minor feels sad.
                In Arabic music, maqamat expand this idea into dozens of unique
                "emotional shades."
            </p>
            <p>
                For example: Maqam Rast feels strong and uplifting, like a
                confident sunrise.
                Maqam Hijaz feels mysterious and exotic, like walking through an
                ancient marketplace.
                Maqam Bayati feels warm and tender, like a mother singing to her
                child.
            </p>
            <h4>What Makes Maqamat Special?</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Microtones:</b> Unlike Western scales, which have 12 fixed
                notes in an octave
                (C, C#, D, etc.), maqamat use notes in between these, called
                microtones.
            </p>

            Think of them as the "invisible"
            notes Western ears aren’t used to hearing. They create unique
            melodies that feel richer
            and more expressive. </p>
            <p>
                <b>Ornamentation:</b> Arabic music loves embellishments, slides
                between notes, rapid
                trills, and emotional flourishes.
                These are built into the maqam system, giving it a human,
                vocal-like
                quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Modulation:</b> A single piece of Arabic music can shift
                between maqamat, like
                changing emotional gears.
                This keeps the listener engaged and adds depth to the
                performance.
            </p>

            <h4> How Is It Used?</h4>
            <p>

                Maqamat aren’t just theoretical—they are felt in the music.
                Musicians use them to improvise (taqsim)
                and compose melodies. The choice of maqam depends on the
                occasion, the mood of the audience, or the story
                being told.

            <p>
                Think of maqamat as an ancient language of emotion in music.
                Even if you
                don’t understand the technical details, you can feel what the
                music is saying whether
                it’s joy, sorrow, mystery, or love.
